Hey, I'm Brendan! I do programming, robotics, and other cool computer things. I am a junior at Cleveland High School right now, where I am the programming captain on the The Pigmice, an FRC robotics team. I'm interested in backend, desktop, systems, and embedded development. I enjoy running, hanging out with fun & interesting people, and learning new things.
