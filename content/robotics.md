FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) is an international high school robotics competition. FIRST is an organization dedicated to teaching STEM to elementary through high school aged kids and teens through their robotics competitions. Last year, 3,647 teams from 27 countries around the world built robots to participate in FRC competitions.

I am the programming captain on The Pigmice, FRC team 2733. We are a student-led team, which means we have mentors from engineering, software, and manufacturing companies in the Pacific Northwest to lend us their sage advice, but it is ultimately our student leadership making the decisions It is also students who are conceptualising, prototyping, designing, and programming our robots at every step. We explore design, electronics, programming, financial management, and leadership to gain and share experience with each other.
