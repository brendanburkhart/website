I have always been interested in 3D graphics - the lighting, materials, and physics capabilities of modern movies and games is stunning, and the math and software behind it is fascinating. I wrote a raytracer to learn more about the fundamentals of computer graphics: https://github.com/brendanburkhart/raytracer. The raytracer can currently render scenes made out of a few primitive shapes (spheres, boxes, etc.) in perspective, fisheye, or isomorphic views. When I have some downtime from both school and robotics, I plan on continuing to build on this project and learning more about graphics and lighting.
